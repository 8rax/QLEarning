# Reinforcment-Learning-Q

This is my repo where I store code concerning solving games and challenges with Q learning.

The first exercise is solving the Mountain Cart, that can go left and right and that should climb a hill

The second exercise is a custom made challenge where we train a blob to eat another blob while avoid a third blob 

Those are based on the tutorial session by Sentdex concerning QLearning and Reinforcment learning
